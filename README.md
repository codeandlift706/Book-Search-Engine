## Description
The purpose of this project is to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
The deployed application can be found here: https://book-search-engine-1lzm.onrender.com/.

## Installation
VS Code to clone the starter code (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli)  and to code the front/back end of the application. GibHub for version control. In addition to the starter code, install the following on the client and server level:
@apollo:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/client.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/server.
graphql:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql.

## Contribution
The assignment provided instructions for the backend setup (resolvers, typeDefs, server file) and for the frontend adjustments to be made (queries). The coding in the server.js file and auth file (imports, boilerplate middleware), the coding in the typeDefs file (graphql syntax), the resolvers (queries syntax) -all the additions- are credited to the curriculum taught in the UCI coding boot camp. I also received assistance from the TA and tutor for additions made to the auth/server files, as well as the debugging made to the queries.
